# bulls-n-bears-gui

Financial data visualization GUI.

This is a project I started up after my bachelor's in finance.
My main goal was to create an algorithmic traiding platform.
Needs to be cleaned up but it is free for anyone who wants a head start.

TODO
1. Add multithreading to solve stalling when uploading new data.
2. Abstraction into seperate files and classes.
3. Create better orgranization of stocks.
4. Add more graphing options.
    a. Candlestick Charting.
    b. Different time intervals.
    c. Graph overlay option (For people who love correlation without proof of causation! :-P)
5. Add artificial intelligence, if I get time to come back to this projects. 
    a. Bitmap Janapese Candlestick Charting signs, then look for signs with neural networks.
    b. Logic based alert system for stocks worth looking at in the moment.
