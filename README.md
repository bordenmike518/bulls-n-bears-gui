# bulls-n-bears-gui

Financial data visualization GUI.

This is a project I started up after my bachelor's in finance.
My main goal was to create a algorithmic traiding platform.
Needs to be cleaned up but is free for anyone who wants a head start.

TODO
1. Add multithreading to solve two problems; increase speeds while uploading data, fix stalling while uploading new data.
2. Create better orgranization of stocks.
3. Add more graphing options.
4. Add artificial intelligence, if I get time to come back to this projects.
